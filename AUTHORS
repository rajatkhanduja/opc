OPC 2006
--------

While the Judge was almost rewritten for OPC 2007, we did take many
elements from the OPC 2006 code (which was taken from OPC 2005, and
possibly 2004). Our code repositories do not date so far back, so from
my weak memory, I remember the following people worked on the OPC 2006
code:

  R Shreevatsa <shreevatsa@cmi>
  KaZiM <kazim@cmi>
  Ramprasad Saptharishi <ramprasad@cmi>
  A B Belliappa <belliappa@cmi>
  Prakash Chandrasekaran <prakash@cmi>


Pre-2006
--------

Legend has it, that the pre-2006 version of the Judge was written
entirely by Indraneel Mukherjee <indraneel@cmi>.
